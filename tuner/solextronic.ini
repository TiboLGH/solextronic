;-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; PREAMBLE
;
; There are several main sections (with brackets around the [section] heading) in this INI file:
;
; - Constants - this is divided into two pages (for recent MS-II code versions, 
;               at least). Page 1 is based on the source code inpram. structure
;               Page 2 is based on the source code in2ram. structure. All of the 
;               values are inputs sent from MegaTune to the MegaSquirt-II
; - Menu (& User Defined) - these define most of the mennus in MegaTune (except 
;                           those that are 'built-in' like the accel wizrd, etc.)
; - Curve Editor and Table Editor
; - Gauge Configuration
; - Front Page & RuntTime & Tuning Config
; - Burst Mode Config
; - Output Channels - this mirrors the outpc. structure from the source code. All 
;                     of the values are sent from MegaSquirt-II to MegaTune on the PC.
; - Datalog - select output channels to log on the PC hard drive
;
; Note: 
;       - To add an input variable to MegaTune, you need to add it to the inpram (or in2ram) 
;         structure in the MegaSquirt source code noting the correct offset (and recompile, 
;         of course), to the Constants section, and to one of the menus.
;       - To add an output variable to MegaTune (for monitoring, logging, or switching purposes),
;         you need to add it to the outpc structure in the source code, to the OuptChannels, and 
;         to the datalog section (and/or the gauge configurations, if you wish to see it directly 
;         in MegaTune). 
;
; In general, the respective notation for variables from the source code to the INI are:
;
;                         signed          unsigned      bytes    bits
;                         ------          --------      -----    ----
;             - char =      S08              U08          1       8
;             - int  =      S16              U16          2       16
;             - long =      S32              U32          4       32
;
; Where the maximum range is:
;
;                         signed           unsigned
;                         ------           --------
;             - char =   -128 to 127       0 to 255

[Constants]

   ;----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ; Constants Definition
   ; --------------------
   ;
   ; Scalar Values
   ; -------------
   ; The scaling and translation values are used as follows:
   ;    msValue   = userValue / scale - translate
   ;    userValue = (msValue + translate) * scale
   ;
   ; I've got no good way to handle a few of these things yet.
   ;
   ; Temperatures are fine, check out the Fielding IAC example (fastIdleTemp).
   ;
   ; The TPS stuff is a problem, because we have to modify the INI file for
   ; each TPS installation and again whenever we move the TPS...
   ;
   ; Array Values
   ; ------------
   ; Arrays are specified just like scalars, except that they have a "shape"
   ; entry in the fourth parameter.  The shape allows you to define lists or
   ; tables, for example [8] defines a list with eight values and [2x4] defines
   ; a table with eight values (two rows and four columns).  Tables may be
   ; stored in either "X-" or "Y-order."  X-order means that memory is laid
   ; out as follows:
   ;
   ;     [x1,y1] [x2,y1]...[xn,y1] [x1,y2]...
   ;
   ; Y-order would be
   ;
   ;     [x1,y1] [x1,y2]...[x1,yn] [x2,y1]...
   ;
   ; To use the TableEditor, you must define two lists and a table, and
   ; the lengths of the lists must correspond to the shape of the table.
   ;
   ; Bit Fields
   ; ----------
   ; Bits are numbered 0-7, the rightmost being bit zero.  The basic
   ; data word that stores bit fields must be unsigned.
   ;
   ; You need NOT supply the correct number of labels matching the
   ; number of bits you've specified (one bit requires 2 values, two
   ; bits requires 4 values and so on).  If you neglect to supply enough
   ; labels, they will be synthesized using the sequence "1", "2" and so
   ; on based upon their position in the sequence (the cltType and matType
   ; will end up with identical lists).

[Menu]

   ;----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   ;  There are five pre-defined values that may be used to define your menus.

   ;  merely draws a separator (horizontal line) in the menu.
   ;
   ;     std_constants
   ;     std_enrichments
   ;     std_realtime
   ;     std_warmup
   ;     std_accel
   ;
   ;     std_separator
   ;
   ;  Additionally, to support MegaSquirt-II firmware, there are two standard
   ;  dialogs to generate its three embedded tables.  The first of these acts
   ;  like Roger Enns' EasyTherm, but only works for MS-II.  The second one
   ;  generates the internal AFR table required for proper closed loop operation
   ;  in MS-II.  Use these without page numbers, as they will just be ignored
   ;  in any case.
   ;
   ;     std_ms2gentherm
   ;     std_ms2geno2
   ;
   ;  If you use any of the std_constants, std_enrichments or std_warmup
   ;  editors, they may be optionally suffixed with a page number (only
   ;  useful for multi-page code variants), which causes them to edit the
   ;  specified page.  If you leave off the page specifier, they edit logical
   ;  page one as specified in the Constants section.
   ;
   ;  There are four special menu names, which when used append to the standard
   ;  menus of the same name instead of creating a new one.  The menu names
